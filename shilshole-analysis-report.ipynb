    "# 2023-2024 Shilshole sea lion study\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "In mid-May, 2023, about 45 sea lions began to use the central docks of Shilshole Marina as a haulout. Compared to their normal haulout location nearby, on the south end of the Shilshole Marina jetty, this move led to a substantial increase in close interactions between wild California sea lions and humans. The change in haulout dynamics was probably caused by multiple attacks on the sea lions by mammal-eating Bigg's killer whales in the spring of 2023: first outside the jetty in April during the day, and then under the cover of darkness inside the south end of the jetty on May 12-14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative impacts on humans due to the shift were reported or observed to include: increased noise from the sea lions within the marina; scat on the docks and the associated smells; damage to the docks (including a fire caused by the sea lions nearly capsizing the end of I-dock); and the risk of physical conflict (e.g getting bitten) especially for Shilshole Marina staff who undertook hazing of the animals with guidance from WDFW and NOAA. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Insert image or video of hazing efforts?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Positve impacts on humans included: a normally rare chance for marina tennants, staff, sailors, visiting boaters, and marina guests to observe these wild marine mammals at close range without needing a boat (e.g. from the fuel dock or I dock -- both of which are publically-accessible); an opportunity to learn about CA sea lion dynamics within the main basin of Puget Sound; and, increased potential for outreach and education regarding the ecological role of CA sea lions within the Salish Sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Insert images of kids watching from boat en route to fuel dock and sailors observing at end of I dock*\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative consequences of the change in haulout location for the sea lions may have included increased risk of negative interactions with humans (i.e. being harassed, or harmed by weapons or boats), and slightly longer distances to potential food sources. Positive consequences may have included more effective evasion of predatory killer whales, increased flat and warm haulout space (docks protected from prevailing winds), increased proximity of food sources within the marina, and easier access to the haulout because the floating docks are always ~0.3m above the sea surface whereas the jetty haulout requires ascending 3-8m of riprap depending on the tidal height.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "The California sea lion is part of a conservation success story that began with the passage of the [Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-protection-act). \n",

    "Sharon Melin, a NOAA biologist who has been studying CA sea lions for decades, providee this introduction to their biology via email:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is a treat to have these beautiful animals in our backyard pool for study!\n",
    "\n",
    "San Miguel Island is home to one of the largest breeding colonies of California sea lions in the US. About 100,000 animals breed there annually, representing about 45% of the total US population. Each year since 1987, we have branded 200-500 pups of about 25,000 born. We then monitor their survival, reproduction, and movements each breeding season. Our branded animals have been observed as far north as southeast Alaska and as far south as Central Mexico. \n",
    "\n",
    "Males disperse from the colony in August after breeding is done and travel all along the west coast, mostly moving northward. Not all of them come up to WA; many stay at haulouts in CA and OR, British Columbia or Alaska. As they age, they travel farther north. So, when they are juveniles, they mostly stay in CA and southern OR; but as they get older and stronger, they often move farther north. Territorial males average 12 years of age when they first hold territory. The oldest male so far in the NOAA tagging study was 19 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, adult females are resident at the colonies year round if they have a pup. That's because their pups are dependent for up to 11 months after they are born, so the mothers have to return to the colony every few days to nurse their pups. Then they leave again to feed at sea. They give birth to their first pup when they are about 5-6 years old and many have a pup almost every year until they are 15 or so. Our oldest female was 23 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they are in CA, these sea lions eat rockfish, anchovy, sardine, market squid, and hake. When they get to WA they add herring to their diet, along with a bit of salmon and other fishes. They are considered generalists and will eat many species of fish or cephalopods if they are abundant. After fattening up in the north, they travel south again to arrive at the breeding colony in late May and June.\n",

    "## Increased predation by Bigg's killer whales in Puget Sound\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time that CA sea lions have recovered in the Northeast Pacific and increasing utilized Puget Sound for feeding during non-breeding periods, the populations of other marine mammals have also been recovering. Harbor seal populations in most sub-basins of Puget Sound have returned to near carrying capacity after intensive culling in the mid-20th century. Harbor porpoise populations in Puget Sound have recovered from periods in the late 20th century when they were commonly killed as bycatch in local gill-net fisheries. Steller sea lions have increased their use of the Salish Sea, including a small haulout as far south in Puget Sound as the east side of Marrowstone Island in Admiralty Inlet. Small cetaceans like the minke whale and other baleen whales like humpback and gray whales are occuring more often within Puget Sound proper than in the previous few decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these marine mammals are potential prey for Bigg's killer whales, a type of orca that ranges from CA to AK. Distinct from the salmon-seeking Southern Resident killer whales, Bigg's orcas were previously known as \"transient\" killer whales because they occurred comparatively rarely and briefly in Puget Sound. In the past 5-10 years, however, more and more matrilines of Bigg's killer whales have occurrred more often and for longer periods, likely in response to the increased availability and diversity of their marine mammal prey.\n",
